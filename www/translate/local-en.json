  "FAQ.R1_1": "Whereas standard business cards don't last forever, a Buzcard is alive, simple, and efficient.",
  "FAQ.R1_2": "The 'forever' QR code printed on the back of your buzcard refers to your on-line business card which is confidential & updatable. Buzcard is definitely the ultimate networking tool!",
  "FAQ.Q2": "Buzcard is not a Social Network. It's a personal tool to create and stimulate your own network of contacts, no matter if they are 'buzers' or not. ",
  "FAQ.R2_1": "Your 'forever' QR code refers to your confidential webpage which can contain your contact details, a photo, links and ALL your social networks.",

  "FAQ.Q4": "As I may have to send my buzcard, should I know how to scan a QR code?",
  "FAQ.R4_1": "NO, neither your interlocutor nor YOURSELF need to scan your QR code.<br>Rather than scanning, the simplest way to access to your on-line buzcard is to have the APP on your smartphone.",
  "FAQ.R4_2": "You can thus access it in ONE CLICK, then send it to your interlocutor who gave you his email address (orally or via his paper business card).",
  "FAQ.Q5": "How does it work if I don't have any Internet access when I want to send my buzcard?",
  "FAQ.R5_1": "Here is all the interest of developing Buzcard mobile app (available for Android, iPhone & Windows phones).",
  "FAQ.R5_2": "Even without access to Internet, thanks to the Buzcard app, you can access your on-line buzcard, and write down the email addresses of your various interlocutors so that an email (in the language of your choice) with your vCard can automatically be sent to your interlocutor as soon as you recover an Internet connection.",
  "FAQ.Q6": "What do you mean by on-line, paper & ultimate buzcard?",
  "FAQ.R6_1": "The on-line buzcard is just your digital profile hosted on Buzcard.com; it is sold as an annual subscription.",
  "FAQ.R6_2": "The paper buzcard is a traditional paper business card which contains your QR code that redirects to your on-line buzcard",

  "FAQ.Q8": "What do you mean by follower? Anything to do with Twitter?",
  "FAQ.R8_1": "It is true that Buzcard is a sort of opposite of Twitter because it's your job to transform your interlocutor who gives you his/her email address into a follower of your future updates of your contact details, links or news.",
  "FAQ.R8_2": "It is almost as if you gave him/her a subscription to your personal newsletter giving him/her the possibility to unsubscribe in each email received.",
  "FAQ.Q9": "Can I see all the email addresses of the contacts to whom I sent my on-line buzcard?",
  "FAQ.R9_1": "Your Buzcard account includes both your on-line buzcard updatable as you wish- and all your contacts.",

  "FAQ.Q12": "Why do you distinguish between 'contacts' and 'followers'?",
  "FAQ.R12_1": "All your contacts are not necessarily your followers.",
  "FAQ.R12_2": "Some people can scan your QR code from paper buzcard or click on your QR from your email signature.",
  "FAQ.R12_3": "Of course they can decide to have your vCard sent to them by email, without being notified of your updates.<br> The contact lists that you import from your address books become automatically your followers.",
  "FAQ.Q13": "I see that I have $20 of sponsor credit but I did not sponsor anyone. Bank error in my favour?",
  "FAQ.R13_1": "The Buzcard Team is particularly proud of having invented the concept of 'subtle sponsorship'.",
  "FAQ.R13_2": "Assume that Jessica L sends today her on-line buzcard to Julien G and that the latter orders on Buzcard.com in 2 years time.",
  "FAQ.R13_3": "Just after his on-line payment, the system will assign $10 of sponsorship credit to Jessica L, unless it has to assign it to another Buzcard user who has previously introduced the concept to Julien G.",

  "FAQ.R15_3": "In case you stop paying for the service, no track of your content will be stored on Buzcard servers.",
  "FAQ.Q16": "What is the interest of adding my QR code to my email signature?",
  "FAQ.R16_1": "You probably write more emails than you physically meet people.",
  "FAQ.R16_2": "It is, therefore, in your interest to encourage these recipients to discover in one click your on-line buzcard enriched with a photo, links & descriptions.",
  "FAQ.R16_3": "Your email signature could also gain in sobriety by containing only your name, QR code & 2 explanatory lines.",
